<h2>Personality</h2>

<p>In his AU, he is bent on destroying AUs which he considers 'glitches' 
or 'mistakes' in the multiverse. He is all black with a black hoodie, black 
pants with one blue stripe on each side, a red shirt, blue tear streaks down 
both his eye sockets, yellow teeth, black hands with red fingers and yellow 
tips. (he is sometimes portrayed to wear round red eyeglasses)

<br />
<br />

Abilities
Error Blaster: He uses a type of Gaster Blaster called an Error Blaster, which 
are simply Gaster Blasters that are black in color and have blue tear-marks 
falling from their red eye sockets. Error's Gaster blaster is bigger, faster, 
and stronger than Classic Sans'.

<br />
<br />

Blue Strings: He uses blue strings to tie up and shatter SOULS, if his strings 
go inside a victim, he can transfer his soul into the victim's body, making his 
body vanish and the victim's soul to vanish turning the victim into him. This makes him able to control the victim, while the victim is helpless. This is Error's "main weapon" because Error feels more comfortable with the strings, as Error doesn't have very good eyesight.

<br />
<br />

AU Jump: He can also jump into one universe to another along with other glitchy 
powers and quirks.</p>
