<h2>Personality</h2>

<p>He likes making art on canvases. When he gets too excited he will often 
throw up black ink. He is always happy to visit other AUs. Ink has the strange 
habit of checking every AU version of Sans' height because he is slightly 
smaller than the Undertale Sans. But in some fan-comics, Ink is shorter than 
all of the Sanses but Blueberry. He is often childish though.

<br />
<br />

Ink is very forgetful and often stops mid-sentence, or writes things down on 
his scarf to try to remember them. He likes to motivate people and make them 
laugh, usually by "being a jerk". Ink wants a soul and is shown being embarrassed 
or sad when the topic of his paint vials comes up during conversations with others.

<br />
<br />

It has been confirmed by Comyet that, despite popular Fan-made theories, Ink is 
not Lawful Good. It was stated in a picture that Ink is "Chaotic Neutral, at best."

<br />
<br />

He also literally cannot care for others without his paint vials, due to lack of 
having a soul. In the Star Sanses comic, Ink and Dream fight because Ink does not 
care for the emotions of the people inside the AUs. This argument was ultimately a 
flop because of Ink's short-term memory, and Dream's inability to feel negative 
emotions over periods of time (longer than a few seconds).

<br />
<br />

Ink is often associated with Error Sans and in different AUs. They are either 
companions or enemies. Some people also ship them, mostly because of that old 
saying, "opposites attract."</p>

<h2>Appearance</h2>

<p>Old Appearance:

<br />
<br />

Ink has ink blot on his right cheek. His eyes are usually a blue circle in the 
right eye socket and a star in the left. He wears UT Sans' jacket hung around his 
hips, brown, long sleeves with blue lines and a light shirt; a protector is on his 
shirt, attached to his chest. Ink wears a giant brown scarf which is almost as big 
as himself. He has a work belt crossing his chest, with rainbow paint vials (which 
have heart-shaped tops) on it. When Ink drinks what is in the vials, he gets 
artificial emotions. Ink has pants that have the same color scheme as his sleeves. 
over the pants, He wears light brown shorts. Instead of slippers, Ink wears sport 
shoes with tiger prints on the sides. He also has fingerless gloves.

<br />
<br />

On his back, Ink holds his signature weapon; His paintbrush (which he names it Broomie). 
Underneath his clothes are swirling tattoos that fall from the top of his neck, down 
his spine and rib cages until finishing up at the very start of his legs. The tattoos 
run 1/4 down his arms and are covered by his undershirt.

<br />
<br />

Current Appearance:

<br />
<br />

Ink retains many characteristics from his old appearance, including his eyes, his 
paint vials, the ink blot on his cheek, his scarf (although it has become slightly 
larger). He still has Broomie, his paintbrush.

<br />
<br />

He now has a white long-sleeved undershirt with a small brown jacket over it. His 
brown pants are actually overalls with the tops tucked into his waist. The legs are 
very wide at the bottoms, with creases around the legs. He also has no shoes. Instead, 
he goes barefoot with a pair of leggings.</p>
