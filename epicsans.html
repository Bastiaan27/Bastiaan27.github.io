<h2>Personality</h2>

<p class = "epicsanscolor">He loves to say "Bruh" often, occasionally replacing words with it. 
He is generally lazy and casual, similar to classic Sans. He gave himself 
the title of "Epic!Sans" just because it sounds cool. If in the right 
conditions, he can become a nerd comparable to that of Alphys. Epic! Sans 
tends to be a huge flirt to anyone he finds cute. Whenever he's around his 
best friend Cross (From Xtale), he often engages in meme related antics.

<br />
<br />

When the situation calls, he can be serious and shows uncharacteristic 
maturity when doing so, despite the omnipresent appearance of his favorite 
phrase. Epic! Sans isn't the kind of person who easily forgives, especially 
when he's betrayed. He'll fight for his friends even at the cost of his life 
if need be.

<br />
<br />

In the original story, Epic! Sans was a fusion of Sans and Gaster, which is 
how he got his scar. His personality as a result was 90% Sans and 10% Gaster.

<br />
<br />

In the reboot, he's mostly the same, except he isn't fused with Gaster at all. 
As the royal scientist, he's quite intelligent.</p>

<h2>Appearance</h2>

<p class = "epicsanscolor">Epic! Sans wears a black and purple long-tailed trench coat that has a 
Half-Soul and white ribbon on its back. He wears black gloves that allow his 
fingers to show. For his bottoms, he wears black striped pants that are tucked 
into his boots.

<br />
<br />

Most of the time, the left socket where his scar is will be empty, but a magical 
purple eye will manifest when he's emotionally stressed, focused, or trying to 
intimidate others.</p>
