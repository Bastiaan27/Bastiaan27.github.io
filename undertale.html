<h2>Review Undertale</h2>

<p>Undertale's opening cinematic hints at a cliche RPG where you awake in a mysterious 
world and embark on a journey in hopes of returning to your normal life. Despite the familiar premise, 
you quickly discover that looks can be deceiving. While many games can take a heavy-handed approach to
teaching you the basics, Undertale does so in a way that not only introduces you to the tone of the game, 
but teaches you not to accept anything at face value. The first character you meet compels you to play nice, 
but as the cheerful music turns to sinister laughter and your new "friend" declares you an idiot, you get it: 
expect the unexpected. Undertale makes a name for itself with unusual storytelling techniques and combat 
mechanics, setting itself apart from the games it seems to imitate. It's also cleverly written and constantly 
subverts your expectations. There are so many wonderful experiences in store that are tempting to spoil, but 
to go into too much detail would ruin the element of surprise: one of Undertale's best assets.
<br />
<br />
While it seems to be a game that's designed for RPG fans first and foremost, a lot of Undertale's jokes have 
universal appeal. A pair of comically incompetent skeletons regularly spout puns and jokes while attempting--and 
failing--to halt your progress, and the social ineptitude exhibited by one character when they try to express their 
feelings for another is a regular source of laughter. With clever characterization and unexpected responses to 
actions we've been conditioned to view as predictable, Undertale elicits laughter and delight with ease.
<br />
<br />
You're encouraged to stop and engage with NPCs rather than charge through the story, and you should, because 
the varied and entertaining cast of monsters reveal valuable information about the wider world. This quality 
isn't unique, but here, it leads to unusual exchanges that are filled with great quips, simultaneously poking 
fun at games and human nature alike. The script tip-toes into parody, but an air of earnest thought lifts it 
above mere mockery. Silly as it can be, Undertale delivers poignant observations that challenge the status-quo.
<br />
<br />
It's also the sort of experience that encourages you to come back for a second or third round. This is especially 
true because, over the course of roughly five hours, you make a lot of decisions that impact the world around you. 
The importance of choice is often felt during combat, which lets you pick between fighting or talking your way out 
of conflict.

<br />
Sometimes the secret to winning is a little bit of love.
Sometimes the secret to winning is a little bit of love.
Trying to pacify opponents is a far more rewarding experience than simply fighting, and its a process that's unique 
to each type of enemy. To earn their favor, you have to analyse an enemy's behavior and figure out the right course 
of action. In one scenario, you can attempt to befriend a violent dog, in another, you might want to cheer up a ghost 
with low self-esteem; your success will depend on your ability to empathize and react. Navigating social puzzles is a 
refreshing change of pace for what seems like traditional combat, and the variety of distinct, entertaining enemies you 
engage with helps stave off a problem that's all-too-common in other RPGs: repetitive random encounters.
<br />
<br />
Because not all enemies are easily wooed, you eventually need to defend yourself regardless if you intend to fight or not.
Undertale handles this with a quirky mechanic that feels out of place at first, but it eventually grows on you because it 
makes combat engaging and unpredictable in a good way. Enemy attacks appear as waves of projectiles that fly within a 
square pen, and as they fly by, you have to steer a small heart icon out of their flightpath to avoid taking damage. 
It's an unusual mechanic, but it's simple to understand and rewarding in the sense that it lets your reflexes-rather 
than statistics or dice rolls--dictate the outcome of a fight.</p>
